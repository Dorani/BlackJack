Proposal-BlackJack
-------------------

Going to be making the casino table game blackjack. The game has 1 player who is laying down bets against the casino(house/computer). The point is to have the sum of user's cards get as close to 21 as possible, while having a greater sum than the computer, this is how you win. 

User will see a betting area, a bankroll area, a count on card value totals, a deal button and a reset button.

I will be using javascript to create the logic behind the game. I will be using css/html to make the game visually pleasing.
